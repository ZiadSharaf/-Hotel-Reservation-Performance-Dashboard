##🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI** (Power Query / M, Data Modeling, DAX)

---

##🧹 Data Cleaning

1. **Renamed columns** to readable/consistent names.
2. **Fixed invalid ADR values**: negative ADR values were converted to positive (absolute value).
3. **Handled missing values** by replacing missing entries with the label `Unknown` (categorical) or using domain-appropriate defaults.
4. **Removed irrelevant columns** (PII or unused fields) such as `credit_card`, `phone-number`, `email`, `name` before analysis.

---

## Data Modeling

Built a date dimension and converted the main table into a star schema with the following dimensions:

* `Dim_Date` 
* `Dim_Country`
* `Dim_Customer_Type`
* `Dim_Deposit_Type`
* `Dim_Distribution_Channel`
* `Dim_Hotel`
* `Dim_Market_Segment`
* `Dim_Meal_Plan`
* `Dim_Reservation_Status`
* `Dim_Room_Type`

Fact table: `Fact_Bookings`

Relationships: `Fact_Bookings` -> each `Dim_*` via keys.
